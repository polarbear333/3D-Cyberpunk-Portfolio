# 3D Cyberpunk Portfolio Website with Drone Navigation

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an immersive, interactive 3D portfolio website where users navigate a procedurally generated cyberpunk city using a drone. The environment will feature neon-lit streets, towering skyscrapers, arcade games, and atmospheric effects. Each building or hotspot will represent a project, displaying details when the drone approaches or interacts with them. The site will combine a striking 3D experience with a minimal, clean 2D UI for navigation and content display.

## Design & Aesthetic

### Visual Style
- Dark, futuristic ambiance with neon accents (blues, pinks, purples).
- Glowing signs, dynamic light effects (bloom, lens flares), and subtle fog for depth.
- Cyberpunk-inspired typography and minimal UI elements.

### 3D UI Design
- The main interface is a 3D city where users control a drone.
- Interactive landmarks serve as navigation nodes and content triggers.
- A subtle 2D overlay provides menus, project details, and navigation hints.

### User Experience
- Smooth drone navigation with intuitive controls (acceleration, deceleration, roll/pitch adjustments).
- Responsive interactions such as hover effects, clickable hotspots, and subtle animations.
- Dynamic URL updates for deep linking to projects or city sections.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Three.js** for 3D scene creation and rendering.
- **React & React Three Fiber (optional)** for a modular, component-based approach.
- **GSAP** for smooth animations and transitions.
- **Tailwind CSS (or similar)** for styling the 2D UI elements.

### 3D Scene Setup
- Initialize a Three.js scene with a perspective camera, fog, and a WebGL renderer.
- Implement ambient and directional lighting for a moody, neon glow.
- Use FlyControls or a custom control system for drone-like navigation.

### Cityscape & Asset Creation
- Construct a cyberpunk city using a mix of simple geometries and custom 3D models (Blender or asset libraries).
- Apply emissive materials and custom shaders for neon effects.
- Use post-processing effects (such as bloom) to enhance glowing elements.

### Navigation & Interactivity
- Implement raycasting to detect proximity to interactive hotspots.
- Trigger animations or overlays when the drone approaches a landmark.
- Use GSAP for smooth transitions between 3D navigation and 2D UI overlays.
- Handle dynamic URL updates as the user moves through different sections.

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize 3D models and textures using Level of Detail techniques.
- Implement lazy-loading for non-immediate assets.
- Ensure responsive design for performance on mobile devices.

## Content & CMS Integration

### Project Content
- Each building or hotspot represents a specific project with images, descriptions, and links.
- A simple 2D content module overlays the 3D scene for deeper engagement.

### Content Management
- Consider a headless CMS or JSON configuration for easy content updates.
- Ensure modular and real-time updates supporting both 3D interactions and traditional UI.

## Expected Deliverables

### Design Document
- Wireframes and storyboards outlining the 3D scene layout, hotspots, and UI flow.

### Technical Specification
- Detailed breakdown of the tech stack, control schemes, asset requirements, and optimization strategies.

### Prototype Code
- Modular codebase including a basic Three.js scene, drone controls, interactive hotspots, and a minimal 2D overlay.

### Deployment Guide
- Instructions for building, testing, and deploying the project (e.g., Vite, Netlify/Vercel).

### Documentation
- Clear documentation of code, design decisions, and future expansion areas.

## Additional Considerations
- **Ambient audio/spatial sound** for an enhanced cyberpunk atmosphere.
- **User accessibility features** such as keyboard navigation or simplified UI options.
- **Research inspirations** from existing interactive 3D portfolio websites.
- **Procedural generation** techniques for a dynamic cyberpunk cityscape.
- **Performance optimization best practices** including model optimization, texture compression, and lazy loading.
- **Exploring CMS solutions** for efficient content updates.
